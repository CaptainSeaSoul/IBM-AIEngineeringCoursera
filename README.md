# IBM AI Engineering 
AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning:
In the final course of the 6 course series, learners apply their deep learning knowledge and expertise to a real world challenge. We use a library of our choice to develop and test a deep learning model. In my case it's PyTorch. We will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.<br>

Learning Outcomes:
<ul>
    <li>determine what kind of deep learning method to use in which situation</li>
    <li>know how to build a deep learning model to solve a real problem</li>
    <li>master the process of creating  a deep learning pipeline</li>
    <li>apply knowledge of deep learning to improve models using real data</li>
    <li>demonstrate ability to present and communicate outcomes of deep learning projects</li>
</ul>
